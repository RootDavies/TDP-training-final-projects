# TDP-training-final-projects
These projects were to show that I could make a programs in C#, and JS.
They needed to be able to searchable and data could be added. 
There were quite a few issues initially with getting the code to work correctly because I didn't understand the syntax but as I built the program it became clearer. 
Once I had the code working I could experiment with diffent wording and see the results.
