# TDP-training-final-projects
These projects were to show that I could make a programs in C#, and JS.
They needed to be able to searchable and data could be added. 
There were quite a few issues initially with getting the code to work correctly because I didn't understand the syntax but as I built the program it became clearer. 
Once I had the code working I could experiment with diffent wording and see the results. 
Why are we doing this?
These projects show my understanding of the JS logic and being able to use JS with HTML to create a workable input platform for employee data.
I was also able to generate code for C# and add to a table then create reports.
How I expected the challenge to go?
I knew that this was going to be an enjoyable project with considerable challenges due to the fact that I had only just been introduced to C#, JS and HTML.
What went well?
It was good to be able to use previous examples from sessions in my training to populate the code and develop the project. It was good when the code worked correctly and rather satisfying to see the searchable nature of the program.
What didn't go as planned?
In a few instances I had not known how to create an element within the program due my lack of previous C# and JS experience. I needed a bit of assistance with the syntax and finding the most logical way to move forward so that the program would work correctly.
Possible improvements for future
I would like to be able to become more knowledgeable with C#, JS, HTML and CSS to be able to manipulate the UI and create a more user-friendly platform for interaction.
